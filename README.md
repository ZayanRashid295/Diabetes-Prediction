**Diabetes Checker**

**Overview:**
This Jupyter Notebook analyzes a dataset to predict the likelihood of diabetes using a Random Forest Classifier. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction for new data.

**Key Features:**
- **Data Loading:** Loads the diabetes prediction dataset.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Encodes categorical features and scales numerical features.
- **Model Training:** Trains a Random Forest Classifier on the preprocessed data.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluates the model's performance using accuracy and F1-score.
- **Prediction:** Makes predictions for new data instances.
- **Documentation:** Includes comments and markdown cells for better understanding.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Add visualizations and summary statistics to explore the dataset.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Experiment with different hyperparameters to optimize model performance.
- **Cross-Validation:** Use cross-validation for robust evaluation.
- **Feature Importance:** Analyze feature importance to understand key predictors.
- **Model Persistence:** Save the trained model for future use.
- **Error Analysis:** Examine misclassified instances to identify patterns for improvement.
- **Conclusion:** Summarize findings and provide recommendations based on the analysis.

**File Structure:**
